# COMP 426: Modern Web Programming

Developing applications for the World Wide Web including both client-side and server-side programming. 
Emphasis on Model-View-Controller architecture, AJAX, RESTful Web services, and database interaction. 

Web application architectures have advanced considerably with the advent of AJAX-based web services and backends. 
This course will cover the key technologies underlying a modern HTML5 web application including HTTP, HTML5, CSS, 
JavaScript, AJAX, Node.js, Angular, and React. We'll take a close look at the JavaScript as a functional language 
and its prototype-based object model.
